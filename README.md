**Abstract:**   
Scientific endeavour is reliant upon the extension and reuse of previous
knowledge. The formalization of this process for computational modelling is
facilitated by the use of accepted standards with which to describe and
simulate models, ensuring consistency between the models and thus reducing the
development and propagation of errors. CellML 1.1, an XML-based programming
language, has been designed as a modelling standard which, by virtue of its
import and grouping functions, facilitates model combination and reuse. Using
CellML 1.1, we demonstrate the process of formalized model reuse by combining
three separate models of rat cardiomyocyte function (an electrophysiology
model, a model of cellular calcium dynamics and a mechanics model) which
together make up the Pandit-Hinch-Niederer et al. cell model. Not only is this
integrative model of rat electromechanics a useful tool for cardiac modelling
but it is also an ideal framework with which to demonstrate both the power of
model reuse and the challenges associated with this process. We highlight and
classify a number of these issues associated with combining models and provide
some suggested solutions.
